<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<!-- 
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
 -->
Developing an IOT solution to acquire and monitor environmental conditions to support plant growth. The focus is on growing plants and monitoring their specific needs using hardware sensors with a Raspberry Pi. This includes the humidity of the air, water moisture in the soil, and light. Using this data that is collected, accurate decisions can be made on how to improve and optimize the plant growth (Example. The plant needs to be watered or the plant has too much sunlight or the temperature is too low). The main idea of this project can extend to many practical applications, which gives it a lot of potential.
<!--
Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
